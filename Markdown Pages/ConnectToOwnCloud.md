    **Important**  

    For best security, your ownCloud server should be SSL-enabled so that you can connect via HTTPS. The 
    ownCloud Android App will test your connection as soon as you provide it and tell you if you entered it 
    correctly. If your server has a self-signed SSL certificate, youâ€™ll get a warning that it is not to be 
    trusted. If this happens, click the **YES** button to accept the certificate and complete your account 
    setup.  

5. Now you are connected and ready to use the ownCloud Android App.
